# shopping-cart-only-js
Shopping Cart app only done using javascript  

This is my attempt at writing a fully functional shopping cart widget without using a javascript framework.
(It currently depends on jquery but trying to get rid of that too)
All CRUD operations on the cart will be possible and persisted to localstorage.
